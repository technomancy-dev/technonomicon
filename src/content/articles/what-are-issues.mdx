Issues are at their core a collection of things. These can be `articles` links to other parts of the web. Images, Data Visualizations and much more.

They are meant to tie things together in a consumable package.

If you are making a course, the course could be made of `issues`, which represent topics.

The `issues` bring together many lessons into `articles`.

There are components made for rendering articles in an issue. Like the `<MarkdownSnippet/>` component.
This component is used when you want to render the article directly, instead of just linking to it, or cutting an excerpt.

```mdx
import { getEntry } from "astro:content";
import ArticleTeaser from "../../components/ArticleTeaser.astro";
export const article = await getEntry(
    "articles",
    "article",
);
<ArticleTeaser
    markdown={article}
    components={{    
        {/* Components to override or add */}
    }}
    cta="Read more about getting started"    
/>
```
