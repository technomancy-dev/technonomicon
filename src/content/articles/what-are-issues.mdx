Issues are at their core a collection of things. These can be `articles` links to other parts of the web. Images, Data Visualizations and much more.

They are meant to tie things together in a consumable package. 

If you are making a course, the course could be made of `issues`, which represent topics. 

The `issues` bring together many lessons into `articles`. 

There are components made for rendering articles in an issue. Like the `<MarkdownSnippet/>` component

```mdx
import { getEntry } from "astro:content";
import MarkdownSnippet from "../../components/MarkdownSnippet.astro";
export const article = await getEntry(
    "articles",
    "article",
);
<MarkdownSnippet
    markdown={article}
    components={{    
        {/* Components to override or add */}
    }}
    href={`/articles/${article.slug}`}
    class="lg:col-span-6 prose-xl col-span-12"
    cta="Read more about getting started"
    title={article.data.title}
/>
```
